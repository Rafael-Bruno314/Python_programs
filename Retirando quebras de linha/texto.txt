Very recently, it has been suggested that the mechanical damage sustained by bacteria as a result of the interaction with NSS is not sufficient to kill them. Instead, it was proposed that the injury leads to an apoptosis-like response from the cells that ultimately causes their death and that accumulated ROS can induce this response, even once the mechanical stress from the nanofeatures has been removed.86 These recent works demonstrate that the processes involved in bacterial death on NSS are still not fully understood and that the picture may be much more complex than first thought, especially when considering the biological mechanisms that may be involved. The nanoscale nature of the interactions between the NSS and the bacterium makes direct visualization of the bactericidal mechanism extremely challenging; therefore, much of the consensus on how bacteria are killed is inferred from investigations into the role that the surface parameters play in the bactericidal efficiency of NSS.
